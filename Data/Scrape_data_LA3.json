There was a bag of groceries left from the last guest in a bag on the table. No batteries in the remote,I fount one battery that was in the bathroom sink drain. Room smelled like cigarettes. Gross dirty towel and food wrapper under my bed. The towels that were provided had a smell as if they were not dried all the way and the floor mat gross no wash clothes were provided. The fire detector was missing oh no its was put in the refrigerator that didn't work so the food I payed for went bad. I turned  the temperature up and the freezer took two days to freeze a bottles of water. And still the refrigerator didn't get cold. Beds in the picture can't be the beds that we slept on they were thin and very uncomfortable and lots of dust on bed frame outside on the corners very visible.Got a parking ticket because they forgot to let us know that the city was doing work and we were never notified thanks for the heads up. Walls were dirty as if a kid was kicking the walls or someone's bike tires were being rubbed up against the walls. The beds had old bedding and two small smashed pillows that are there for your comfort. Oh don't forget about the homeless guy who lives right outside and the garbage outside. What a sight. We just went to the nearest Target and grabbed candles,defuser,towels,food and batteries to try and enjoy my stay but I feel ripped off $200 cleaning fee they could have went to the dollar store and got hands towels, candles, spray.ect...Damn it LA Damn it.i would have put more pictures but they only 4.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fepic fail  !!!!!"

When we finally got to the hotel and headed to the bathroom to shower, the toilet lid was disgustingly dirty, the shower head fell on our heads (pay attention because if you\u2019re 5\u20199 or taller you\u2019ll have a hard time showering). The shower has low pressure which makes you take a long time to shower. Second: we couldn\u2019t believe in the mattresses: it was SO annoying and old, super discomforting, you could feel all the metal parts on it since the filling was very poor and thin. We booked the studio from February 17th thru February 21st but we left on the 20th because we couldn\u2019t stand sleeping so poorly. We barely spent time in there, only for sleeping and on the 19th someone from guest services called me while I was trying to have a good time on the beach saying there were complaints about us being loud??? We found it really disrespectful because as stated before we just went there to sleep and was always respectful and thoughtful of others. When we were looking for a place to stay in Hollywood and this studio came acros, I saw some specific complaints like the cleanliness and fridge not working. I decided to give it a try and contacted the host asking about the complaints and he said the fridge was fixed and would make sure to get the studio deep cleaned. We took food with us and we needed a fridge in good condition and surprise: got there and the fridge wasn\u2019t cooling, we had to put all of our food in a cooler with ice, so much work! The sheets were very old and not clean, lots of stains, the AC was terribly dirty and would bring down allergies if we turned it on, so we were hot basically the whole stay. Plus, be aware of parking! host doesn\u2019t provide parking and it\u2019s TERRIBLE to find parking in the area and if you do, you can\u2019t park overnight. A trip that was meant to be de-stressing just caused us so many headaches."

I waited on the steps of the booking for over an hour. They told me the housekeeper was looking for parking. When i called the housekeeper she said she was still at her other job. I sat on the ground outside for over an hour waiting for someone to come. When the housekeeper arrived she hit the lockbox with a rock until it opened and that is how we got in. \nOnce here for a couple hours they sent someone for a repair they did not i form us about.\nThe shower head flew off and we asked for help and they would only send help if we pretended to be their cousin. \nI have tried for days to get help and they have accused me of lying and pretending like they don\u2019t know what i\u2019m talking about when I have pictures and videos for all evidence.

Then once they was corrected. The guy at the front desk told me to get cash even though I already had reservations with my card. He stated that the card machine was broken even though I just saw him use it and charge another customer right before me. They need to be shut down cuzz it was trash and disfunctional.

The condo was nice and comfortable, however there were ants in the kitchen and master and the coffee machine didn't work.  They came to confirm coffee machine didn't work but didn't replace it during our trip. Again not worth the price we paid. And the service was not acceptable for the price we paid.",

Even with the windows closed, the noises are extremely loud.\rWe booked the apartment for 5 nights and left early after just one night and booked another accommodation. This has never happened to us before! This was the worst accommodation we have ever had!\rThe owner is extremely unfriendly, makes promises and does not keep them. The worst we have ever experienced. It is an absolute cheek to rent this apartment to travelers and despite multiple complaints we have not received a refund.\rAbsolutely caution! This is a scam and do not be fooled!"

I asked for a refund, he refused, he not agree for it.  \rit was dirty and very uncomfortable, from the window, in short there was a strong blow over my head, I did not sleep at night.  \rMy child has a cold and suffers from otitis media after that night.  \rThere was no sheet, and the blanket was very stinky, terribly dirty.  The shower was very cold, there were no utensils in the kitchen to cook something.  When I asked to leave the bag for an hour, he said - get out!\rThree taxis was afraid to take me, because this is a dangerous area and I had bags, they were afraid to stop for a long time.",

The jets on off button is in the office and I could not get staff on the phone several times when I wanted it on or off. The jets weren't strong anyways. I feel completely ripped off and overcharged for the room I got I could have stayed on the beach in a luxury hotel for that price!"

                    "Review_Dislikes": "It is difficult to find. It is not a scam, but it is not surprising that some guests find it so. THERE ARE THREE LOCATIONS OF ALMOST THE SAME NAME: 41st Street, 41st Drive, and 41st Place. The accommodation is at the last one. We went to the previous two first, and spoke to their owners. They receive many lost travellers. The manager of the accommodation did not care at all, and we got the email with (not much detailed) instructions on how to find the place only after check-in.\rWe had BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE MANAGER. We were allowed to keep luggage after check-out based on the condition of giving a 10-star review. We found it odd but agreed. On the last day, I had difficulties with the online system to do the review (and I think it is likely possible only after the manager marks us as checked-out, for which I had to remind him). The manager was then in fact black-mailing us through phone, threatening to throw our stuff away (emphasizing that the cleaner was coming, he did not give an answer what he really meant by that) in case we wouldn't submit the 10-star review within the next hour, then 45 minutes... The manager said we had to contact the support service of Booking.com in case the the review was not accessible in my profile yet. I tried to explain that I was doing my best, and would submit the review as soon as it appears in the online system. \rWe managed in the end after one hour, and I had to send screenshots to prove that I was not lying. It was very stressful. I am changing the review right now. What the manager said was probably not even true, the cleaner came only many hours later, in the evening (when we returned for our luggage), and was not much into cleaning anyway. It was one of the most arrogant staff I have experienced during years of travels in different parts of the world."

Some of the people staying inside the home are not safe either.  there was a point when the restroom had 0 toilet paper and was not replaced until 2 days after the toilet paper was done.  no soap in the bathroom to wash hands either, had to wait a couple of days until anything was finished.  the toilets had crap all underneath it and people used the kitchen past 10pm all the time.  there is no security on the premise except cameras so no one really puts anyone in place when they are breaking some type of rule, except of course if you park in the parking lot and pay an extremely over priced amount when already paying this Andy person an extreme amount of money for a very horrible stay."

There were no hanging hooks in the room itself (I was in LA for a professional event & wasn't able to hang up any clothes), nor is there any sort of accessible closet space. There are small black ants everywhere. In LA you get what you pay for, and I am certainly aware of that. This was a last minute trip and was happy to secure the space, so I cannot fault the building or its hosts. Just not what I was expecting. This is a great value stay, especially for the LA area. If you're looking for no-frills this is the place to go."

Not feeling well could have been something more serious and they still disregarded all of my attempts to contact them but when I called from another phone number they answered immediately. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate of other guests.\nThis is the worst hospitality staff I've encountered. This place is just another mediocre AirBnB operating out of a more run down neighborhood with no public transportation nearby. \nI parked in the driveway to check in, intending only to be there for a few minutes while I unpacked my heavy bags so I wouldn't have to carry them halfway down the block (they charge a daily fee to park in the driveway) but the 'receptionist' (can only speak to them through a camera on the front porch haha) would not send me the code and allow me to enter the house to take my things to my room quickly and then move my car. He said I had to move it before he sent the code, even though I had already paid in full for three nights, and then he threatened to tow my car and hung up on me.\nThese people are rude and dismissive. Nothing hospitable about them. The mattresses are on the floor and there are ants and insect traps all over the house. If you want a cheaper place to stay in a less than ideal part of the city then by all means..."

I had to text them the entire time with questions. Having a document with a set of instructions for guests upon entering the house is something that we shouldn't have to tell them to do. That is a basic necessity if you're going to be renting your house to anyone. The house was extremely dirty, there were stains everywhere. The hot tub and pool controls were not working. The garage door opener wasn't working (positive: they sent a new opener via Uber quickly). The theater room TV did not work. There were about 10 propane tanks in the backyard and every single one of them was empty, couldn't use the heaters. The toilet in the master bathroom didn't flush. The garage door popped out of the hinge and wouldn't close. \rOverall, this house is not kept up at all."

The beds were not of a good standard too.",

Positiv anzumerken ist auch ein eigener Stellplatz nur Achtung - dieser wird mit 20 Euro pro Tag berechnet. Die Info hierzu ist in der Anzeige recht versteckt. Der Verwalter (oder Besitzer?) ist sehr zuvorkommend und geht auf die W\u00fcnsche ein. Bspw gab es im Appartement keinen W\u00e4schest\u00e4nder. Dieser wurde am n\u00e4chsten Tag direkt besorgt. Gut. Wir mussten einmal nachfragen ;)). Die Gr\u00f6sse des Appartements ist f\u00fcr 5-6 Personen ausreichend, allerdings ist die Angabe drei Schlafzimmer falsch, da ein Doppelbett hinter einem kleinen Paravent stand.",

I'm used to traveling a lot, I've visited many places around the world, having been to more than 30 countries and known many people, but I have never met a person as rude and dishonest as the Owner of this room.\nMy disadventure started with me being just 10 mins late in respect to the booking hour (something i told him during the reservation) and, nevertheless, the Owner did not let me in the room, with the absurd justification that the person in charge of performing the check-in was already gone away. Moreover, after denying me access to the room (through a self check-in) he told me through the doorbell (that does not work properly, you can hear little to nothing) to go away and contact Booking to file a claim. Of course he kept the money, refused to refund me and deleted my 3 days reservation, so that night I found myself alone without any chance to get a room in an unknown and unfriendly neighborhood without internet connection (just for 10 mins late).\nI managed to get by but I am not sure that anyone else in that situation would have been able to make do.\nI decided to make another reservation the next day for that same room thinking we could find an agreement on what happened but he never answered back, refused to refund me and even encouraged me to leave a review on Booking. Most importantly he made me do a self check-in infact there is no person in charge for check-in.\nThe kitchen doesn't have enough items, i had to share the a couple of fork with other guests and also, no salt, no oil, no napkins.\nThe room doesn't have any soap and toilet paper and there was a lot of noise all day because there was a house being built exactly next to my room.\nBe aware that he runs several rooms on Booking that will be not affected by this review but those are in the same building, so keep in mind if you are considering a place in the same area, probably it's his property as well.",

Kitchen was very well appointed with a stove, both Keurig and regular coffee makers, a kettle etc. Room had our own fridge/freezer, so there was never an issue with food going missing. Really nice size dresser/closet in an alcove in the bedroom. Check-in was all done remotely by phone/security camera and, while it felt a little unusual initially as we've more often stayed in hotels, it was very smooth and all relevant information was provided promptly. Great safety measure for anyone who is still Covid wary! All doors use security number locks - no risk of losing a room key, or of needing a second key if you go out separately. Just a few minutes' walk from the Science Center, Memorial Coliseum, Banc of California Stadium, Natural History Museum etc.",

On the phone I asked where I can wait under a roof till they send me instructions how to get in. I was told: \"you are in LA, rain is normal here, wait for instructions by SMS and don't complain about the rain. If we talk longer, you will stay longer in the rain\". It would be so easy to tell me that the entrance is in the backyard and that I can wait there under the roof!\n* The house is in a very poor area of the city, public transport is far away.\n* Bad parking situation on the street. The parking in the backyard is 15$ per night and not 15$ per stay!\n* Room is very small. It is officially for 4 persons, but to small for 4 persons, Even for 2 persons it is to small. I was living alone, and it was OK, but second bed was taking all free space.\n* It is written that the room has an air conditioner. That's wrong!\n* It is written that the room has it's own bath room. That's wrong! Only a small restroom, so only a toilet.\n* It is written that the room has it's own kettle. That's wrong!\n* It is written that the room has it's own stovetop. That's wrong!\n* I was in november, and it was cold in the room. Very small electric heater is not enough.\n* Room was not really clean.\n* In the end of the stay I was asked if I want to stay longer. I asked about the price, and it was higher that the price at booking.com. I was told that if I don't like the offer I have to book online. At the same time they have blocked me on booking.com, so that I was not able to book this or other rooms of the same owner online! When doing the payment I got a pop up \"booking can not be accepted because of an incident during the previous booking\". This never happened to me before, very bad experience.\n* After the stay I requested several times an invoices / receipt of payment. I also asked booking.com to help me with it."

The attendant had a very thick accent so when I asked for the wifi code I couldn't understand him so requested he write it down and when he did, he threw it at me. Oh yeah there was no ice machine, iron or blow dryer. The air conditioner in our room sounded like a diesel truck each time it came on which made it difficult to sleep. Don't take room #104."

He also knew we had nowhere to leave our bags till check in and wasn\u2019t flexible with check in time. \rAdditional Costs\rThe washing machine available is only available at an additional cost even though it doesn\u2019t state this on the booking - perhaps this was naive of me to think it would be free but it should be marked as an additional cost. \rLocation\rHeard gunshots whilst waiting in the park and police helicopters circled the area for nearly half an hour afterwards."

However it was located 11 minutes away from work. \nUpon arrival few guesses was loud to the point that the cops was called. Saw a couple small roaches in the sink the morning after. \nThe remote control did not work well and back cover that support batteries was nowhere to be found. The TV was not plugged in and took me some few minutes to figure that out. Very frustrating.\nStaff was nice up until they knocked on door around 9:50am to remind me of checkout time at 11:00:\nAlso during my stay it rained real hard and water started to come through the bottom of door. I had to use two of my dog's training pads to stop water from coming in."

I feel unsafe too, i can hear some guests fighting from the other rooms. I would never go back to this place.",

On the blanket was also dirt. The other guesta you can hear like they are next to. Summarized we felt really uncomfortable and not treated well by the host. When we asked to let our package in the house after we checked out for some hours before our flight started the host wanted 25$ and it would be not protected. I just can give everyone give the advice not to go there even if it's so cheap. It's a creepy place, where they just want to make profit.",

Upon walking through the location I was immediately surprised by how dirty and unkept the unit was nothing like the pictures on the website. He then preceded to show me to the room I was renting for 1 night. I WAS SHOCKED! There was no sheets or blankets on the bed just a bare mattress, the floor and walls were filthy and the bathroom was disgusting, there was even urine in the toilet from a previous guest. He then told me he is also renting out the living room to someone who will also be checking in today.The counter tops were dirty, the shower was dirty. It's like the room had not been cleaned in months. I'm not sure how he felt it was okay to show a room that was that disgusting. I didn't even stay...I cancelled. Stay Away he just wants your money!"

Someone pounded on my door at midnight and screamed in another language. The front door to the bldg is not secure. No hot water - only \"less cold\" if you wait long enough."

In the room where I ended up staying, there was mold and bugs everywhere (in the bed, in the shower, on the floor, on the dresser) and the shower head fell off and mold/ dark liquid came out when I first turned the shower on. The owners didn\u2019t even offer any compensation whatsoever, they were unresponsive, and they insisted I pay through zelle and not through booking so now I\u2019m stuck making claims with my bank. I was visiting LA and ended up finding somewhere else, but was incredibly disappointed with my experience with this property and the hosts.",

The bedroom was a good size the bathroom/toilet with all the amenities you can expect even better than a regular hotel. The bed was comfy plenty of pillows and a smart tv with all the regular online programing and apps. Free internet yes it was free and fast. Of course the crown jewel was the window that overlooked Venice beach that was perfect. \nThe staff even let me put my backpack in the storage room after my checkout and i was permitted to use the showers and toilets which was very convenient before my flight home. There's a small kitchen with free basic breakfast in the morning. The interiors with nice murals and photographs of the area. And you can't beat the location you are in the heart of Venice and a short trip to Santa Monica.\n  Overall 9/10",

                    "Review_Dislikes": "The bathroom availabilities definitely needs to be worked on. Things felt incredibly awkward dipping in and out of toilets, especially late at night \u2014 and subsequently the doors need a tab of oil. The place could do with a (much more ideal) coat of paint to compliment the place, preferably with the external colour scheme. I would have liked to see an extended range of conveniences too."

Location is convenient and central to just about every iconic attraction in LA, so ease of access was great. It's located on a nice quiet neighborhood street, off the main road, which was also nice. It felt safe too.\rThe home was peaceful and relaxed, which we really appreciated. All of our roommates and guests were courteous and everyone respected quiet hours. I like that there was a full kitchen available if you want to cook or store any food. (We didn't use the kitchen, but thought it was a nice feature). They also provided us with sheets, blankets and pillows which was helpful! If you prefer more blankets though, I'd recommend bringing some of your own or a sleeping bag. Definitely bring a towel though. The staff who checked us in was very sweet and helpful. Rooms were generally clean. Common areas were clean and seemed well-kept.",

Each room had 2-3 bunk beds and they were comfortable. There was 3 bathrooms, each with a shower. I couldn't recommend it enough. It was a phenomenal price and the host was so nice and accommodating, not to mention the late check in times was very helpful. There are lockers available and she has a few locks to share, but honestly I asked her if I could just leave my bags in my room and she said that should work fine and she's never had any issues of theft or safety with them and I didn't either. The door to the property is locked and door protected so it's very secure just generally. If you're looking for a good and cost effective hostel, I'd recommend going here. If I come back to LA for another solo trip I will for sure be staying here again!",

To say how many people stay here it\u2019s very quiet and you don\u2019t often see people in the day, at night it\u2019s social and people cook and eat together. very nice :)",

You\u2019d get a snide remark or glare if you made more sound than an average footstep from the folks living there at any time during the day (many worked nights and slept during day).

Although it looked well located on the map, it was far from both subway stations-nothing seemed less than a 10 minute walk away.  I was disappointed here because the pictures were so nice.  Also, despite what my reservation confirmation said, there was no breakfast as of  October 31, 2021."

The hostel itself exceeded my expectations, the kitchen was spacious, as was the dining room and there were multiple common areas throughout the property. It was also a very safe hostel and I think this has a lot to do with the no alcohol policy, it was never noisy or over run with loud drunk people - like some other hostels. The fireplace sitting area, mutiple charge points was an added bonus for anyone wanting to study/work in front of the fire. The library was also an added bonus if the common room downstairs was too busy.\r The extra bathrooms on our floor were a bonus. The housekeeping staff are amazing, always working hard around the clock to keep that place clean! They deserve a medal, its a busy hostel. I will definitely be booking in to stay again when I visit USA - LA.\r Staff were also super helpful with best advice on how to get to LAX - I had to be at airport at 4am, staff organised a taxi pick up for me as my sim card didnt work in country.",

Rooms and all facilities seemed relatively new or well maintained.  There were enough full-sized lockers for every guest to have an individual one - unlike some hostels I've stayed at.  I didn't bring my child, but they apparently do allow children to stay in dorm rooms - I understand sharing a bed with an adult up to 12 or in an individual bed at 13-17.",
                    "Review_Dislikes": "It's Santa Monica, so there will be noises outside from the local homeless/mentally ill.  The bunk bed frames also creaked a lot and sounded like broken sofa springs anytime that I or a roommate moved.  If they could find a way to either fix or replace the beds, it would be perfect.  Also - they have a strict no alcohol policy (not even possession without consumption), which is unusual for hostels - and they ask that any alcohol brought in be held at the front desk until checkout.  But these were minor issues compared to everything that went well."

Common areas were cool, although most people were just on their cell phones not talking. On one of the nights there was a free comedy show, legit LA comedians too, very enjoyable. Location is right in Santa Monica near the beach/peer - it can get a bit crazy on the streets but no complaints about being central.",

The temperature seems excessively warm in rooms and the heater never seemed to shut off despite mild outside temperatures. I initially had a top-bunk but had to switch down because I could barely breathe up there. Some rooms have windows that can be opened, but some don't so can be difficult to air out a stuffy room. The breakfast is very basic and bread focused."

They have a stupid policy which charges you a full day for the evening time and a full day from 0:00 am to early morning. So even if you parked there for like 14 hours, you are charged 2 days' max.",

Though basic, it was perfectly adequate and kept us going most of the day. The hostel is located on a nice, safe street, just one over from the coast and near the 3rd street promenade. Bus connections were fantastic and easy to use. Bathroom facilities were very clean. They had hairdryers and fresh bath mats for every guest.",

Also, depending on what you want to see in the city santa monica might not be the greatest location since it's an hour from Hollywood, for example. Not a big thing though because the main attractions in LA are all spread throughout the city, so it's hard to find a central location (again, depending on what you want to see there)"

If you're a guy, and just want a place to sleep, then you'll be fine here, just don't try to converse with the staff."

Even though you're in a room with only women, it is nice to not have to be woken up by their early morning or late night activities. A curtain helps with this. When I hung my travel blanket (very small) so that it would provide me this privacy I found a passive-aggressive note on my bed later from the owner that told me that I would be kicked out if I didn't take it down. I thought this was ridiculous and, in some ways, treated us adult guests like children. I politely obeyed this demand - but only during the day - at night I put it back up because at the end of it all I am a paying customer and it isn't my fault if this hostel hasn't modernized to align with the norms of hostels worldwide."

They are separated and you need to rent towel (they give back your money).\rHave a great common area with pool table and a kitchen, some snack machine and a TV but was empty during my time there because of covid.",

Some people seem to live there and have there personal belongings blocking windows and other areas.\rThere aren't enough showers or toilets, although they keep the ones they have clean. But again some guests are not respectful. \rThe area isn't safe at night, so if you're a woman, you have to Uber after 10pm. If you drive, parking is difficult. All metered around and very little space elsewhere, also dangerous to walk to hostel at night."

The hostel is VERY well located and it's so easy to arrive there from anywhere in the city - bus and metro stops across the street just made our life SO easy. There's a mini market downstairs and a lot of food chains and shopping malls steps from our door so getting food never was something to worry about. We loved the free breakfast - it was very simple but we always felt pretty full. We had a shared bathroom but it was pretty close to our room and it was pretty clean - never had to wait for using showers or toilets. The room was very  spacious and the bed was so comfy! It definitely is worth the money and I'd recommend anyone to stay there!",

Located at a super strategic place, I went to a concert at the Hollywood bowl and I walked like 10 minutes from the hostal to the venue. The price is good for what you get. Everything is so clean, common spaces are big enough, with a great view to the Hollywood walk of Fame at the kitchen and the main common room. I was very surprised of how calm and quiet it is at night, no noise was filtered from the walk of Fame. There's a 24 hr market below the hostal (hostal is on the 2nd and 3rd floor of the building), also there's a public parking behind the building and I payed 30 USD for a overnight parking (I arrived at 4 pm and left 11 am next day). ATM at the kitchen. The whole staff is so nice and helpful and many of them are bilingual (English and Spanish). They offer you breakfast from 7 am to 9 am: 3 types of bagels to choose, cream cheese, jelly, butter, oranges, oat bars, coffee and tea. Dispensers with fresh water available for everyone at any time. Wifi was great.",

But the experience was very good, I met nice and respectful people.  The hostel has a bath towel, sheets, blanket, pillow;  in the bathroom there is liquid soap, shampoo, conditioner, free of charge.  There is a drinking fountain with cold water.  The staff were polite and helpful.  Breakfast is very simple, just loaf of bread, butter, cheese spread, orange and coffee.  But you can buy and make your own breakfast.\n Despite the hostel being on the walk of fame, a busy avenue, I didn't hear noise at night to the point of disturbing my sleep, even though I'm a super light sleeper.  One of the beds in my room made noise in the springs for any movement of the guest, this is bad.\n The hostel complies exactly with the Checkin and Checkout time, there is no option to enter the room before 3pm, nor stay in the room after 11am;  but you can stay at the hostel, use the sofa, bathroom, kitchen, etc, except the bedroom.\n I really liked it.",

They are NOT, as I was made to pay an extra $2 for mine.

Not a huge concern since unlikely to rain most of the time. \rThey need quiet times/lights out added to the hostel. people would just randomly turn on the lights after 11 pm. They do have some kind of curtains around every single bed, which slightly helps."

However things such as rude staff who are cold/impolite, staff who also stay in the shared dorms with you, staff who don't stock toilet paper in the bathrooms, staff who have a sincere lack of professionalism and beg their coworkers(?) for food in the common areas... the list goes on.\nThe female staff will do a \"courtesy knock\" but don't wait for you to answer and walk in on you changing, they will bang around with no regard for if anyone is sleeping/barge in before 9am while travellers are asleep (with no previous warning) and clean the bathroom poorly (with very strong cleaning products) and did not turn on the exhaust/left the bathroom wide open and gave all the people in the room a headache. At one point there was no hot water for a whole day/night and I was told \"sometimes its just like that\" and to be patient.\nAgain, maybe some folks find this all OK. And if we were given notice about things or were treated more politely I could have understood, since this is \"just a hostel\" and I understand that it's not meant to be some grand experience. But as someone who has stayed in many hostels around the world, this might be one of the worst ones simply because I did not feel welcome and felt the staff very strange/disrespectful and the experience too baffling.\nThe actual manager (owner?) himself seemed very adept and kind (when he was actually around) but he made a mistake hiring almost every staff member because the incompetence made the whole experience incredibly uncomfortable."

The beds do not have separate reading lamps or power sockets.\nStanding lamp in the room was broken.\nThere was also a mice problem on the community balcony and staff went through people's belongings and threw stuff that looked like trash away, which is unacceptable.

You\u2019ll need to pay me $25 for me to answer your questions.\u201d I\u2019ve been backpacking around the world for a year at this point, and have generally had wonderful experiences with volunteers who share their time off to answer questions and share travel advice. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t happen here. Another staff member asked me where I\u2019m from. I said \u201cAmerican\u201d to which he half-jokingly, half-seriously responded \u201coh, boring. I only like Asians\u2026and sometimes Latinos.\u201d I was born in China.

I went to the bed that was empty, there was no one to ask for information and of course the other guests were sleeping, so it wasn't their fault.

Of course I was sleeping with clothes and put a t-shirt on the pillow because at that time I had limited options.... \nAlso the room  is described as having a private bathroom, in a hostel that means that every room has their bathroom, inside the room, no need to take all your stuff to get out of your room... \nThat is totally wrong again in the description... \nThe bathrooms and showers and restrooms are outside the rooms. \nOf course the rooms were in a very bad situation and they were not clean, the lockers were very small."

The area was a little sketchy around the hostel, but once you got onto Wilshire Blvd, it was OK. There's a Ralph's grocery store, but going in there was like entering an armed camp, with security confronting people at the entrance and exit. One guy going in with a box in his shopping cart was being strongly advised not to shoplift by the guard. I was also overcharged for what I bought. The hostel was within walking distance of the Metro but the area seemed pretty removed from everything.",
                    "Review_Dislikes": "When I arrived the one staff member was sitting at the table eating a meal. A guy standing just inside the door sort of confronted me when I walked in, looking at me as if I was an intruder (as did everyone else in the room). The staff guy got up and checked me in; he was perfectly civil though not especially welcoming. When he saw my ID, he informed me that California residents were only allowed to stay one night, as they cater to foreign travelers mainly. There was nothing about that online when I made the booking, but they don't even have their own website (websites cost money). It is a small one-family house split into two apartments, upstairs and downstairs, and crammed with dozens of bunk beds. It was extremely cramped and crowded. The pictures on the Facebook page do not look like any part of the hostel I saw; they may have been of the second floor. The one or two rooms I glimpsed from the hallway looked every bit as crowded as mine, which was in a separate building (some kind of storage shed) behind the house. You had to go outside to get to it, but the area between the buildings was fenced in on both sides, so the only way in or out was to walk the single, twisting corridor all the way through the house to the front door, the only exit. This makes for an extreme fire hazard and is almost certainly illegal. The kitchen is at the very front of the house, right next to the door, so if a fire started there everyone in the building would be trapped. The \"view\" from the window in my room (which was covered by a metal grate) was of a cement wall about a foot away from the building. The beds were the usual cheap metal bunks that make a ton of noise. It was a cool night, which made it uncomfortable because these 3 Japanese guys came in after midnight and went in and out at least half-a-dozen times over the next hour, leaving the door wide open whenever they were in the room. Towels were not provided and they ran out of toilet paper in the morning."

There's shampoo and conditioner in the showers which is handy, and even low lighting inside the pods (as well as bright) if you want to read before bed. You're about 2 seconds from Venice boardwalk and plenty of bars and cafes within reach. If you don't want to splash out for a hotel, definitely check this place out. Regardless, the atmosphere is way cooler than any hotel would be, anyway! Its the perfect blend of personal space and social, so you can choose to network or keep to yourself as you wish.",

The view from the roof and the front room was insane, just so lovely seeing the beach on your door step. Having bikes available and laundry facilities was super handy. It definitely felt like a home away from home and the people I met there really did make the stay much nicer considering I was solo travelling.",

If you\u2019re looking for something in between, I couldn\u2019t recommend this enough. \rA few of the highlights for me in no particular order:\r- friendly and helpful staff\r- comfortable and quiet pods with light for reading and USB and power for charging \r- space to store your gear and a locker you can set your own code for to keep valuables (no need for a padlock)\r- amazing location right on Venice beach with an incredible view from the roof terrace\r- full kitchen with space to store food, coffee machines (nespresso and percolator), fresh water, and ice \r- sit stand desks if you need to work or do admin  \r- bikes to borrow for free to go explore plus yoga mats and a roller. Though I couldn\u2019t take part, they also had HIIT and yoga sessions. \r- great bathrooms with towels (including beach) included plus body wash, shampoo, and conditioner\r- loads of space to lounge about and chat with the others around",

Also, the way the space is designed, there is open space between some of the floors (think of a loft).  This is nice and open during the day but because a bit of an issue when some people were watching TV on the lower level and I was heading to bed in a pod above.  I was able to close my pod door and that blocked much of the sound but not all of it, as there were no walls between the spaces despite being on different floors.  I was tired and fell asleep quickly but this could have kept me up.  I could have said something but really didn't want to bother the folks watching TV and felt that if the lower level had a proper ceiling to separate it from the rest, it wouldn't have been an issue."

Me encant\u00f3 que dan la sensaci\u00f3n de privacidad que uno teme no tener al ir a este tipo de hoteles, uno cierra la puerta y se siente en un cuarto para uno solo. Los ba\u00f1os y la cocina se mantienen demasiado limpios, todo es super moderno, tienen caf\u00e9 gratis y me gust\u00f3 que tienen espacios marcados espec\u00edficos para cada persona colgar la toalla y poner su comida en la nevera. \rLa decoraci\u00f3n es super linda, se nota que pensaron en cada detalle. Los espacios comunes son muy c\u00f3modos y la casa es tan grande que no se siente casi la presencia de los otros hu\u00e9spedes, lo cual da una sensaci\u00f3n de silencio y tranquilidad muy especial, pero a la vez el set up permite socializar y hacer amigos, me fui con 3 nuevos amigos!  \rLa ubicaci\u00f3n es perfecta, al frente de toda la playa, con restaurantes cercanos, Abbot Kinney a unos minutos caminando, entonces se puede tener f\u00e1cil acceso a todo, tambi\u00e9n al transporte p\u00fablico.\rEl internet para trabajar tambi\u00e9n s\u00faper bueno.\rMe encant\u00f3 el lugar, volver\u00eda siempre!!",

We called and they didn't pick up, but eventually we were let inside, but couldn't check in. The girl at reception was playing a computer game and didn't want to talk to us until later. She seemed unhappy to answer any questions, but maybe that's just a California thing? She was friendlier once her computer game finished. \rThere was only one bathroom, which had the shower and toilet inside, so a bit of a wait in the morning."

What a nice idea. I slept in a room of 8 people and barely noticed anyone. Reminder* this is not the most mod or potentially safe but I had no problems and slept v well. I reccomend top bunk! Bathrooms are nice too :)) thanks so much to the owner hope your intentions were well making this project I assume. All in all give this place 7/10 no down rating in any particular manner I said 7, cuz I feel it suggest how good it actually is without having the high expectations people let down. I reccomend anyone else to take this stay if they were in the same position, making something out of life. It can be a difficult journey but this place was right on time. Safe travels!!",

The apartment was extremely hot upon walking in, and nothing could be done to remedy it. Had two fan units running in my room and despite the white noise coming from it, I still couldn't fall asleep due to the noise of the other guests. This was genuinely the worst hostel I've ever been to. I get it, hostels aren't private places, but the fact that I had to share 2 bathrooms with 16 strangers was very concerning."

Our request for a late check-in was categorically denied by the hostel administration.  and that night, in the truest sense of the word, we had to spend on the street. \nBooked a room in a shared room for men and women.  in the end, they began to settle in a room with full of men.  the room smelled awful.  it was dirty.  all the belongings of the guests were scattered on the floor, not to step through. we were offered a room in a building through the wall. the other, new building of the hostel was much cleaner and cozier than the first option.\nif you arrive by car, please note that parking on the road next to the hostel is unrealistic.  as the hostel is in a residential area.  Parking on site is very small and super inconvenient.  parking fee $10-night."

This hostel also has a bad neighborhood (a friend from LA also told us that when he picked us up). Even a staff from the hostel said to us that we should not leave the building at night. The beds weren\u2019t really stable. you have to buy toilet paper by yourself. The worst  thing was that someone in the room next to us died because of drugs.

One morning I went to three different bathrooms and not one had tissue. The bathroom was never cleaned (saw another girl from my room cleaning up trying to help). A man came into the women\u2019s room around 3:30am on my third night saying he thought it was the bathroom. Front door is always open and folks hanging in and out of that open door all night/morning. They had several issues with my payment after I had paid. The lady working check ins is nice but not tech savvy. Truly a mess."

There were 2 spoons and a knife. That's it!\nI've never stayed at a hostel that had absolutely nothing in the kitchen. Crazy!\nSmoke detectors were beeping all over the place. I informed staff that batteries needed replacement. Solution was to disconnect batteries, which did not stop beeping because smoke detectors are hard wired. Beeping for 2 days drove me crazy!\nThis is also a very serious safety concern. If power goes out, no smoke detectors to warn guests.\nNo place for guests to congregate and socialize. Only few cheap hard plastic chairs in kitchen area.\nThis hostel should had made sure they were ready before they opened. Apparently, they just opened recently. They were not ready to open.\nAlso, toilet paper was almost impossible to come by if you were not an early riser. They put out a roll in the morning, and that's it, unless you can hunt somebody down to beg for another roll! Hope you can hold it! Lol!\nThis hostel has enormous potential. It is in a very nice neighborhood. Unfortunately, the neighbors will probably start complaining about the debris and cigarette butts between the sidewalk and roadway. They don't allow smoking inside the gate,  so guests congregate outside the gate. I am certain the neighbors are not liking this. They also have not mowed the area between the sidewalk and roadway in weeks, if ever! It is overgrown and looks horrible.\nWhen the neighbors walk their dogs, they cross the street! I don't blame them! I am certain this hostel's days are numbered if they don't attempt to \"fit in\" to this very nice neighborhood. You can't have people hanging outside the gate smoking weed and drinking booze on the sidewalk. The neighbors are not going to put up with this for long."

Having a detailer come through and do a thorough deep cleaning of the walls and base boards and then diligent cleaning of the bathroom will bring the whole thing together b/c the idea is fabulous!"

Bathrooms are big and provide with shower gel and shampoo. Every bathroom was equipped with a hair dryer too. Breakfast was included. Good selection for a free breakfast in a hostel.

So if your roommate decides he needs to sit on the toilet for a half hour, NO ONE else has access to a toilet or shower or sink. It's all in one room- I've never seen a hostel like this. Whoever designed this clearly hasn't stayed in one. The layout makes no sense. 4 bedrooms with 10 people each: that's 40 people with 4 toilets but you only have access to the bathroom that is assigned to your room so if it is occupied, you can't use another bathroom.\nCleaning lady NEVER. SHUTS. UP. Constant complaining, dropping N-word, F-word, drinking wine at 8am. No one wants to hear this after a day of traveling. No chance of peace and quiet here. This place is one step above a halfway house. A Mix of foreign tourists and unhoused locals.\nGuest from another country was mugged walking back from the bus stop. Workers telling him he shouldn't have worn red and blue shoes in gang territory. He was scared and confused and they were telling him \"I told you so\" over and over again.\nI wanted a partial refund as I refused to return for my 2nd night stay but ALL day as I tried to cancel online I received an error message to \"try again later\". I tried ALL DAY until it was too late to cancel. I still didn't go back. My safety is more important but I DESERVE a refund for the 2nd night. Messages to the person in charge were met with responses of \"first I'm hearing of this\" and other fragmented, partial sentences. I don't think they know how to speak in complete sentences and clearly don't know how to run a business.\nPaid for 2 nights, stayed one.

Two hours after check in time, the manager came to the hostel and told me there was no room available for me at that location and offered a room at a different place a mile away and offered to drive me there. Communication was poor and handled unprofessionally. As a solo female traveler, it caused a lot of stress and made me not trust the managers or the stay, so I decided to leave and last minute find other options.",

I reserved a room with 4 beds and my friend and I were barely able to get 2 beds in the same room. they had to take us to the property down the street and put us in a co-ed room with 8 beds. also unsure if the sheets I slept on had been cleaned. during my whole stay there I didn\u2019t meet the house manager or speak to any staff except when I checked in. the only thing convenient about this hostel was that it was cheap and close to a bus stop."

I\u2019m talking about ghetto housing development criteria. Some dudes looked like cocoons wrapped in their beds while some stared into nothingness. Creepy stuff I say. Never again. Not even a glimpse of hope or friendly gesture was seen. Very sad indeed.",

Place is hoarded with people to an astronomical scale. Ridiculous. No food was available nearby and you couldn\u2019t even trust for dear life to have a personal belonging in the room without someone snatching it away blindsight. The vibe overall is very depressing and bland. Honestly just the structure and management itself should consider to have the place completely removed from existence. Definitely NOT safe for newcomers alike."

After setting up the manager came in and said I'd been given the wrong room. His co worker showed me my new room. I again set up and was in bed when the manager again come to my room and demanded that I was not to sit on a bed untill he saw my reservation. I explained that I had been directed to that room by his coworker. I hadn't allocated myself the room. I showed my reservation and that settled the matter. Then exhausted from 17hr flight and time differences I got into bed. Soon another guest returned to this room. Then I found out I was in a mixed dorm. I then vacated the room to find the manager. The manager said there wasnt a bed left in the female dorm. That was the only bed available. I explained that I had prebooked and payment had been taken for a female 4 bed room. Again the manager said he didnt have a female dorm room bed as it was already booked. I stated that I could only stay in a dorm that I booked and was not responsible for the double booking nor was the business able to adjust my booking without agreement. In my view putting me in one without advising me created an unsafe experience of the business and not what I was expecting booking.com for me to accept. The manager refused to listen or resolve the matter with me. Thus at 8pm I needed to vacate this booking and search for accommidation. I felt the manager was agressive and was relieved to be exiting the premesis. There were no key locks for dorm rooms as stated in the advertising. Alltogether this experience was shattering and not what I had expected from booking.com. I would not recommend this business. I have been left with the task of trying to get the expense reimbursed by booking.com as the manager refused to advise booking.com that the dorm had been double booked. The co worker was kind but had no say in the managers decisions."

Like someone just lived there and they rented out the spare bedroom\n2) I booked a private room with a shared bathroom, got there they tell me they don't have single rooms\n3) the room I was placed was someone's bedroom. There were clothes in the closet, and personal items all over the bathroom. One of the bed was fully made with like personal sheets with multiple baskets around the bed\n3) Felt fully unsafe. The room I was placed in locked from the inside but could not be locked once i left. Not to mention the type of lock was was kind that could be unlocked from the outside \n4) The door to the actual housing area didn't have a door knob.  Like, there was a hole in the door where the door handle should have been. \n5) They didn't know I was coming. They needed me to show the booking on my own phone. When I got there they had to make my bed. Like I got there and they had to make my bed \n6) Just a random group of people, I'm assuming the owners friends, were smoking in the garage. Didn't feel safe at all\n7) Felt so unsafe that I literally booked another hostel, this time with HI Los Angeles. They were amazing. Very safe there. \nI would have taken photos of the conditions if i wasn't focused on getting out of there\n \nHINT: If when looking up the place on Google maps, if the name of the Hostel/Hotel/Motel doesn't come up, then it's not a good place"

When I got there Staff told me no private rooms existed and if I wanted my money back I would have to take that up with booking.com I remember seeing it said \"No refunds\" when I booked the room so I wasn't going to even open that can of worms. Staff seemed surprised when I didn't cancel, no doubt they were expecting to keep my money & rent out the bed to the next person, I was there for 3 nights. The property description included a Jacuzzi/Hot Tub, there was not one nor were there any signs there had been one. The place was cleaned daily but I couldn't help feeling like I was in a park restroom that had just been hosed down with disenfectant. The thing I found really unnerving was the fireworks, they would start mid-day and go well into the night sometimes till 1-2am. These fireworks were not the nice ones that do Sparks or burst into the sky, these were ones that had no visual component and made a sound nearly identical to gun fire. It seemed to me that it was a deliberate effort to desensitize you to the sound of gunfire."

The days I got back from the concert I wasn't allowed to shower because \"everyone was sleeping\" mind you there were people upstairs making noise and people eating in the kitchen. The shower was not too clean at all either. It all made me feel very uncomfortable during my stay. I wouldn't stay here again."

I never got anyway to get into the hostel. There was no shoes in the house so you had to wear slippers they provided in a basket by the door those slippers were very dirty so I started using my own. Honestly felt very unwelcomed. Like I entered someones home uninvited. I went there for a 3 day concert that finished around 10:30 pm and by the time we could leave the stadium it was 12. Most of the guests there were also going to the concerts. We let the host know this in advance. We'd leave at 8am and come back at 12 am to sleep.So I really don't understand the hostility towards us specially when all the other guests were very rowdy. Q"

No one wore a mask. The entire family lives in this house and there's no room for guests except for the bed or outside.",

There's a big dining room table but only for family use. Guest must go to the kitchen and use the small table and tiny hard metal stools. The air vents in the restroom don't work ,so when someone goes to the restroom you can smell it and it takes an hour to not smell the feces. Each room has 3-4 beds crammed in and again no masks while you're with perfect strangers. Small airline blanket and junk all in the rooms. They have a big new refrigerator but paying guest can't use it they must go to the back porch and use the old rusty run down crowded fridge that has old spoiled food. I left to get food and they almost started cheering and said Byeeee. I said I'm not leaving I just got here. The young son came to me asking me if I was taking photos of the place Whule I was looking for urns. My father passed away and this was a last minute emergency stay. I told him my name and he didn't like my Mrs. Title mind you I have 2 grown-up children his age. Also they were gossiping about me in korean. Yes I do understand some korean. This place should be banned. It used to be better years ago maybe they're the new owners or just lazy and broke. They take advantage of ppl especially African Americans who are the #1 customer staying there. It's in a decent area but it was very unsafe getting there at night. I was bullied into leaving a good review but I can't think of anything good or positive to say about this place. Again the lady is very aggressive and mean. Her japanese husband is quiet and let's her get away with treating customers badly. I'd rather sleep on a bed of rocks than pay to be here. Disgusting but for the homeless people here I guess it's better than skid row. Horrible and I can't believe that booking.com has this place listed."

They were consistently micromanaging me and interfering in my privacy.while at the property. Constantly coming into the room without knocking and as early a s 9:00am. I was told upon arrival that an extra 3% would be charged on my credit card even though there is no mention of this in the booking and you can only reserve a room on Booking with a credit card. I refused to pay this accordingly so and the woman still overcharged my card without my consent. I was told I was not allowed to hang clothes or my towel on the room divider as it made the room look like a homeless shelter which I found very offensive. She came into my room at 10:00am and yelled at me for this and ripped off my clothes and towel that were hanging on the divider. I was really shaken up after this experience as I informed her I was in a virtual meeting for work yet she kept yelling at me. A horrible way to experience your morning! The only reason I didn't checkout was because I wouldn't get refunded my money. I was not thanked for my business or acknowledged while checking out of the property. There are signs telling you no alcohol, no taking a shower after 11:00pm or before 7:00am and to limit your time to 10 minutes.Also everyone must takes their shoes off at the door and wear the slippers provided or your own. Overall I would not recommend as you are staying in someone's private house which you will not feel welcome and you are watched and monitored constantly including having the owners inappropriately entering your room. There were also some issues with other guests being inappropriate and disrespectful even to the point of being verbally abusive but yet it was not handled very well at all by the owners and I did not feel it was a safe place for women to stay."

The bathroom was always busy, they charged me 3.5% because I was paying with credit card, even though this isn\u2019t mentioned on booking. There were someone else\u2019s luggage in the closet of the room I was staying, so eventually one of the hosts went into the room to get it.

                    "Review_Dislikes": "1.- The staff and apparently owners of the house, they are not fluent in English, which is really necessary on these times. both are really nice persons, but the wife never use mask inside the house, I saw her face all the time. The husband used to mask many times, but to talk, he removed. They never push the tenants to use the mask inside the house either. The wife was really sweet and cook the dinner for thanksgiving.  Is a kitchen in the house, but you can\u00b4t used it. Only the microway, toasted oven and the water dispenser machine. Two bathrooms for the whole house, I have to say that I never need to wait more than 5 minutes for the toilette. The upstairs bathroom has the ventilator broken and has no windows. You can't ventilate the bathroom. Ventilation of the close spaces is the key to avoid Covid. Tenants and guests had a small refrigerator outside the kitchen, but basically, the kitchen is for the owners/couple. 2.- I booked and request via message to be placed in the 4 beds room, which looks the biggest in the house and the beds was spread apart. Instead, I was located in a 3 beds room, luckily I had only one \"roomie\", she arrived drunk quite late. When I arrive at the property to the room was empty so I took the bed next to the window. I had the window open all the time, as I didn\u00b4t feel confident with the cough of the \"roomie\" 3.- Some guests are more long term tenants 4.- The neighbourhood is huge. And the exteriors of the house are not well maintained. buckets of paint are stocked around and material used in the past to improve the house. On the porch are two tables, so I ate outside to avoid eating in the \"living room\" wich connect directly with one of the rooms and has two beds dissembles next to the table. In the pictures look nice, but the place is not well maintained and organized. Even with the same layout, they could improve a lot. The kitchen is there, but you can't use it."

A  text message would have been fine.\r3 - One of the other users had put the dryer on late at night which was just outside our room, which then encouraged the owner to out up some rules, one of which was no drinking anywhere in the house, which for me as a paying customer was a little strange, if I want to have a beer, I don't see why I shouldn't be able too..\r4- The rooms didn't have locks and there was no where safe to put your valuables.\r5- I personally didn't really like the vibe in this hostel, but I think with time this could change.\r6- There are cameras inside the hostel, maybe thats normal, but again, strange vibe.\r7- The beds were cheap and uncomfortable - we had the private double room, 2 small beds for myself and my partner. which even together didn't allow you to move much, you kind of sank into the middle of the bed and were stuck. \r8 - It was much further than i thought to most places in LA"

Language is not a problem, we have traveled the entire world and we have made friends with people who don't speak the same language very easily.It was something else. These dudes were very very sketchy.\nThey occupy the entire common area(entire couch & dining table) so very difficult to hang out in common area, no place to sit or watch TV.\nBed is cheap metal makes noises - mattress is very cheap, very uncomfortable. No locker/safe to keep your belongings. Entire house was creaky and noisy at night as the walls are thin\n.\nOnly 1 thermostat for entire house - random dudes mentioned above set the heating to 86F(30C) - so hot! It was burning inside our room. We went and deceased the temp to 72F, to be comfortable (ideally sleep temp should be even lower). After some time, dudes again increased temperature to 90F(32C). It extremely hot and very difficult to sleep."

Like not eating in the room, which I understood but I would feel more comfortable eating alone than with everyone and I do clean up after myself. And the no shoes in the house rule, which I also understand but had I known that when I booked I would have been prepared with socks because the floor did leave dirt on my feet. The other guest there made complaints about me and instead of coming to me with their issue, they exaggerating the truth which also made me feel uncomfortable as they were not the same race as me and seemed as if they wanted to make me feel unwelcomed. And while they had a problem with me, I never once addressed them for having the back door wide open at night time that kept causing me to wake up because I was freezing cold and also had flies flying around my face. As I was only a visitor of California, I did not make it my priority to go to sleep early so when I would come back at 12am, lights would be out in the rooms and kitchen and it seems like I would have nowhere to where to eat then if there is no eating in the room and lights had to be out in the kitchen after a certain time."

                    "Review_Dislikes": "These guys have just started this hostel and I don't want to be negative as I know growing a business takes time. So instead of negative comments, I'd like to give some constructive  feedback.\nRemember hostels are created by cultures, people and vibes, thats my overall message as a person who has worked and lived in hostels for the last 3 years.. So I would suggest the following:\n1. Reasonable pricing: You can call this place a hostel and charge the prices you charge in comparison to your competitors, if only you provide the basic hostel etiquette and amenities for your occupants.\n2. Please provide lockable lockers for your guests. This is so our valuables are safe, we carried around our laptops as one of the other guests seemed very crook.\n3. Have a system and a reception!  A proper desk space with a computer and a proper booking system would create a professional environment and you would be valued as a business. Instead of someone taking a random photo of our IDs on their phone. He also came and asked THE GUESTS which beds were free the next day. This is knowledge that you should already have.\n4. Communal space should be accessible freely at anytime. I've seen comments about this being a family hostel. And I see that's what you are trying to create, but it was a very uncomfortable experience in general. The common spaces were occupied by friends of the property owner majority of the time who didn't speak English and didn't try to make the guests feel welcome or start conversations with them. We all know basic english even if its small conversation. Ive traveled the world and felt more welcomed in a small ethiopian village without a word of english than i did here. We sat in the room on the floor as we there was no where to sit and relax as no one interacted with us.\n5 . No sleeping in communal areas. people slept on the sofas overnight the two nights we were there. It was hard getting up early to prepare food or even coffee.\n6.."
