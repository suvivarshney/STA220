The room was bigger than I expected and very comfortable, the staff was always helpful, and there were several cafes within 5 minutes walking distance for breakfast. If I'm back in San Francisco I would stay at the Hyatt.",

Also most of the entertainment, bars, and nightclub experiences are in different districts but if you want a high end and quiet place to sleep that's near the ferries to Alcatraz and Angel Island this is for you."

We arrived a few hours before check in and were able to get in early because they had a room available. Which was nice so we didn\u2019t have to drag our luggage around the city waiting for 5pm. We were within walking distance of restaurants, drugstores, grocery stores, etc. If we needed to Uber or Lyft somewhere farther, it wasn\u2019t too expensive and the drivers picked us up right at the front of the hotel where the hotel had seating available, so that was convenient. The area felt relatively safe, we were not out very late though. We would stay here again!",

The same was true for other spots too. We were also extremely underwhelmed with the restaurant. It was marketed as a farm to table, higher-end, and food-allergen knowledgeable restaurant but we found none of that to be the case. The room was also very underwhelming- cleaner than most hotel rooms but small, very cramped and needing maintenance (ie., tun glaze was chipping off very badly, carpet was sticky\u2026)"

It took about five tries to get on the elevator before my husband went to the lower level to save the elevator for me and our baby in the stroller. \nThe only parking lot was offsite 1 1/2 blocks away and the only available parking we found was on the roof.

So the actual room price is nothing near the actual end net price! One should expect it but it\u2019s still sticker shock when you see it. So be forewarned. \nOtherwise.

We were the furthest away from the elevators and didn't find the stairs.  // the vent in the bathroom was small and weak.// was unhappy that a 4 star hotel did not have a microwave, and it had a useless half deep mini fridge.  Also, the hallway carpets really needed to be spot steam cleaned. I could easily see stains on the carpet. Lastly, this is marketed as a pet friendly hotel, but they are not close enough to any real patch of green. There's no reason that part of their front area couldn't provide a 10 x 10 foot patch of lawn for the dogs. Not all dogs or their people want to walk or drive to the closest park when the dog needs to go."

Even tho the hotel isnt in Downtown, its still very close to other tourist points such as Pier 39, the chocolate factory, the cable cars, etc. There's a restaurant in the premises (i didnt try it so i wouldnt know how is it). There's a breakfast restaurant right across the hotel, a 7eleven 5 minutes walk. \rThe people at the front desk stuff are amazing, very friendly and charming. \rThe entrance hall is nice. There's a room where you can buy sandwiches, late night snacks, juices, sodas, etc. There's a pool but i didnt use it. I saw a gym as well which I didnt use either. \rThe beds were REALLY comfy and clean. \rI called to see if I could extend the check out and the girl at the front desk extended for another hour and a half. Im telling you, those people are very well trained and super nice.",
                    "Review_Dislikes": "Before I write this, keep in mind that im the kind of person that ALWAYS try to find the good in every situation, even when the situation is bad. \rLet me start saying that I have nothing bad to say about the front desk people, they are amazing, these negative reviews are towards the hotel itself. \r1. I thought it was very expensive for what it is. I know it is San Francisco and everything is expensive there (I live in Los Angeles, its the same here) but carpet in the room and all the halls ? C'mon, this is 2022\r2. The pressure on the faucet bathroom wasnt strong enough that it took me 10 minutes to rinse off my face after washing it. \r3. This isnt that bad, but if you are thinking on reheating food, forget about it. No microwave in the room. \r4. The valet parking is $62 a day but this is the norm in San Francisco, so I guess this isnt a bad thing about the hotel because whatever you go, you'll have to pay outrageous prices for parking. \rIn general, I thought the price was really high for what the hotel has to offer. And if you ask me if I'd stay here again, the answer is no."

The staff were all really nice and it is in such a great location I kinda wish we hadn't wasted our money renting a car. It is only 2 blocks and you are at Fisherman's Wharf, and a short walk to North Beach and Ghirardelli Square and a cable car turn around is just around the corner. I think the TV was 50\" -  it was definitely bigger than any hotel we have stayed at. There is even a coin laundry on each floor.",

I traveled by myself and was out very late each evening, so I had to walk back to the hotel alone. I didn't feel uncomfortable but I did feel vulnerable. The city has changed over the years and I see more homeless people now. SF was a stop I made but wasn't my final destination, so I also stay there on the way back home. That time I was able to park in the Hyatt parking lot but it was I believe $14-15.00 dollars more, which I didn't expect."

The Hyatt front desk was hostile and non-amenable to any requests with always the same excuse - oh its covid we can't do that right now. EG: I was in the middle of a work meeting and had lunch delivered to the hotel because I couldn't leave and because the hotel has no restaurant open on-site (again because of covid). The front desk would not let the delivery person drop off my order to my room - because of covid - they had to leave it up front. I asked the front desk to have a bellman bring it to my room because I was in the middle of a meeting - they said no, because of covid. Explain that to me? I had to let my food sit out front for 40+ minutes around other guests while I finished my meeting because of the hotel's staff. I thought the customer is always right and it's called \"hospitality\" for a reason. It was also my birthday weekend which I told them and they tried to charge me $75 to put a birthday gift of wine and flowers in my room - which I didn't ask for btw but why would I pay $75 for a gift for myself? Won't be back here again."

However,  the hotel does not offer parking on site so guests have to park two blocks away from the hotel. It\u2019s not a far walk, but with kids and a lot of stuff it became a huge hassle. The room was okay. Not worth the 200 a night you pay to stay here. I felt like the room was setup more for business people traveling, was not as family friendly as I had hoped. There is no microwave in the room. My family doesn\u2019t typically use microwaves, but again when you\u2019re traveling with kids, it\u2019s nice to have. Plus it\u2019s pretty standard these days for hotel rooms to have one. Especially when you\u2019re paying 200 a night.  The sink in our bathroom was clogged, barely drained. I had to prop open the drain stopper to get the water to flow out. It made for a gross sink. There was not bathtub in the room, just a shower. Again hard when you have little kids. When we first got to our room there was no remote for the television. We had to call the front desk and have them bring us one. It took over an hour. Everything costs money here. Water is five dollars a bottle! I wish this hotel, especially in San Francisco, would install a water bottle refill station in the lobby, or on every floor. Pool and spa we\u2019re closed due to covid, even though most pools in California are open now. Overall my stay here was just okay. Served its purpose, but wouldn\u2019t stay here again."

I modified on booking.com to 2 nights from 4 nights with the rate of us367 shown on the app . It was approved .. But when I arrived late at night , the hotel insisted that I booked for 4 nights and wanted to charge me for 4 nights !!!! After hours wasted talking to booking.com , my booking was changed to 2 nights .. I thought my drama was over , but NO !!! The next thing i saw on booking.com app, my pricing was changed to us493 .. Seriously !!! I thought I should be paying only us367..\nThat was not all.. After checking out, the hotel charged me a whopping US1500 for a 2 night stay .. Imagine my horror and the funds being locked up on my prepaid card . I have to spend hours call booking.com and the frustration was that each time the customer service officer is different \u2026. Some are really good and some are super lousy. you can\u2019t get back the previous person who serviced you .. \nTo be fair, I have gotten back my refund.. but if you were to ask me how the stay was.. I can tell you it was horrible.. Service is not on your side . Anything, hotel will tell you to speak to booking.com yourself. they can\u2019t be bothered to check emails from booking.com even when you requested politely for them to do so .. Beware also if you were to leave your card details with booking.com . this hotel will charge u as they wish . imagine i didn\u2019t check my bill and the losses I would have incurred ."

Desk Staff \u201cnot aware\u201d of arrangements; Desk upgraded our room - no desk, small, view of pool - curious as to what the original room was like). Price was totally not worth it - over $1,000 for 2 1/2 days. Standard valet parking fee ridiculous - 2nd Hyatt option to park 2 blocks away at $45 per/day. No help with luggage. Call front desk from room - put on hold for 10 minutes. No concierge, no bell hop. Everything blamed on COVID and short of staff. With limited services shouldn\u2019t the price be significantly reduced?"

The hotel itself very old, the housekeeping is the worse that you can imagine - we asked for an extra bed for our kid (which is supposed to be already in the room since we have booked in advance and mentioned about our stay), and they brought it half wet!!! Literally, it was like it was after the swimming pool. We tried to call to the reception and ask to change it three times, waited housekeeping but after 30 minutes we have discovered that housekeeping works only till 11pm! The room on the photos completely differs from the one in reality. No sofa that is indicated, not that clean. The door to the bathroom we cannot close completely, there were a hole. And at the reception we could not get the relevant information about parking check out times - one guy told us that it is before 3pm, the lady in the morning told it is before 12, and then you will have to pay $40 more, which was again not relevant since at the parking lot there charge was indicated $50! Never ever to Hyatt in the US!"

My husband and I went out for a dinner in McCormick\u2019s while our kids went out to stroll around Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and after that went back to the hotel. They went first to the market besides the front desk to look around for some snacks to buy. The front desk lady already initiated rudeness towards them. When they were looking around, they were surprised to see her standing and watching them as if they are \u201cthieves\u201d or made them feel so uncomfortable enough. To make matters worst is while they still look around and try to ignore the \u201cdegrading\u201d look from that front desk lady, she unbelievably knocked several times to the wooden door of the market to call their attention and said \u201c Are you buying or not??! Do you even have money to pay? And don\u2019t touch anything! \u201c\nMy kids were dumbfounded, surprised and felt humiliated. And this happened in the presence of other guests. They don\u2019t have any idea why they were being treated that way. One of my daughters even witnessed a change of attitude when there was another guest who asked the front desk lady to hold her bag while she grabs something from the market and she warmly accepted the request while they were treated differently. MiSTREATED. HUMILIATED. DISCRIMINATED.\nI and my husband went back to the hotel after celebrating my birthday dinner night so happy and to return to the hotel to see our kids so distraught about what happened, totally ruined everything. We addressed this complaint right away to the manager, Cris, as soon as we were told what happened by our kids. We went straight down to the front desk with our daughter and confronted the front desk lady who mistreated and discriminated them. She called the manager Cris. My daughter even said that Cris saw them when they went to the market earlier.",

Location is rather central. the hotel is very safe. the area also is safe for my standards, but there is visible poverty on some streets in the area. If that is a problem for you, avoid Ellis and O'Farrell St, and stick to Geary St, for example when taking BART train from airport and getting off at Powell. Little Saigon is very close, and there are several very good cheap Vietnamese restaurants. Bike-sharing bikes can easily be found nearby the Luz Hotel.",

I could never thank you enough. Definitely the best place I stayed in San Fran. \rI was provided everything, clean towels, robes, soap, water and even a heater. There was even a smartTV with Netflix, YouTube and everything. At the end of my stay they even gave me a pen as a souvenir from the hotel. \rThe shower and the bathroom were always super clean and very comfortable, I didn't even mind that they were shared. \rThe location is really good, I could do anything nearby and it is safe, very close to union square and Powell Station. it took me 30min to go to places with public transportation from there. \rThe best part, for me, was that the manager speaks Portuguese, and since I'm Brazilian, I felt even more welcome. \rWish I had stayed longer, can't wait to come back! Thank you for the amazing service!",

The first sight of the place shocked me with a shabby locked grille door, narrow, small hallway and dirty carpet, the reception is a tiny window and the room is the same size as the prison cell I visited on Alcatraz trip. When I opened the door to my assigned room, a strong sweat smell greeted me and I told the staff about it and asked for an air refresher and he brought me a fabric spray for the purpose. As a Chinese, I drink boiled water but there is no jug in the room so I asked for one and the staff hurriedly sorted out one coffee maker which he apparently washed hurriedly but still have heavy stains which I tried to wash off in my 5 nights stay but couldn\u2019t get rid of. Apparently the staff tried to make things better for me although they don\u2019t have enough resources of equipment or such. The place is so old and dirty so I feel very uncomfortable and tried not to touch anything. Staff are nice but it can not changed the fact that the place is substandard even by 3rd world country standard. The budget price doesn\u2019t  mean such a poor facility is OK."

What I noticed is that employees don't help you with your luggage, even if you are the only guest checking in or out. You have to make and unmake your bed. I understand this is not a hotel, but a helping hand is greatly appreciated.Helping others wouldn't hurt"

Cow's milk wastes even more water than almond milk (if you don't believe it, look up actual studies) because of how much water it takes to raise the cow (for the cow to drink and to clean the cow and the areas it occupies) but also to grow the crops to feed the cow. So I was shocked to see they were only offering cow's milk. I realize it's a free breakfast and I'm not expecting much, just a plant based milk option such as oat milk which is much more sustainable than cow's milk. Disappointing."

In a beautiful park on a hill, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge on days with no fog, and you can very easily walk towards the piers (Marine Park), Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39.

You literally couldn't move without the crinkling noise making a ruckus which sucks in a dorm where everyone might be sleeping at different times. I was on the top bunk and climbing up there and settling in without trying to disturb others was basically impossible. The dorm rooms were also pretty cramped (to be expected I suppose), though there were roomy under-bed storage lockers (bring your own lock). Whole room smelled a little bit, but with the windows open it was ok."

It's a very nice, short walk to Beach Street and to Gharadellis ice-cream, amongst other things.\n2. Pool table\n3. Outdoor courtyard with comfortable seating\n4. The cleaning staff are lovely",
                    "Review_Dislikes": "1. If you are on your own, try not to arrive at night/in the dark. It's up a secluded dark hill, but it's fine in the day. The hostel could do with having signage on the road and lane, but there was nothing. \n2. Caf\u00e9 was closed and no free breakfast - maybe they just need to get back up to speed after being closed for Covid\n3. No ladder to top bunks (room 22). I mentioned to staff, but this was not rectified. I thought all the top bunks didn't have ladders, but  then saw some top bunks in other rooms did have ladders. This was very annoying, as I hurt my feet clambering up the front of the bed\n4. Avoid rooms 22-24 because you need to walk through the common room each time to go to toilet, have a shower, go to kitchen etc.\n5. Staff go through your stuff in the communal fridge and confiscate alcohol. Not a problem for me, but some travellers were not happy\n6. Strange vibe, not as relaxed as I'd hoped - maybe too many rules? \n7. It's difficult to keep windows open. We had to use books and plastic bottles to keep windows open \n8. The discount you get on bike rental is not a discount. The saving that the bike rental company offers is 'donated' to the hostel.\nHaving said all this, I'd stay again. The location is second to none. Downtown is definitely a place to avoid, a lot of drunks and shouters."

Had to ask a couple of times for support with this as the hostel is in a National park and on the coast so very cold wind and occasional rain was every day but further inland downtown was quite warm. I took a pillow for my back as disables and took it off the bed the last day to check out and discovered ANTS in and around the back of the bed in the room!!  Also no International  postage stamps so had to go and find a post office downtown."

Not true! You also get an email that vaccination status will be checked which also was a lie. Felt they lied to you to fill beds. \rFront desk staff kept telling people they could do laundry starting at 3pm when signage in the laundry room says 4:30pm.\rThere are no vending machines and the cafe listed an amenity on their site has been closed. Again, felt lied to.\rNot enough space to for your belongings to store. The boxes under the beds are too small and open the wrong way so the lid slams down on your hands as you are trying to get things out. No place to place things like glasses etc at night. \rNot enough electrical outlets in rooms and no extension cords."

We were in one of the double bed rooms, it was okay to sleep somewhere after a long day, not so small,  definetely not the most resting experience with the door slamming in the whole night, but its a hostel, so can't complain.",

So there can be days/mornings, when you hear them (I mean very loud horns, you wake up for them) from there. One of our morning started at 4.30 AM, because it lasted for 2 hours, and heard in every second minute, so earplugs are recommended."

Tocaban el piano durante la noche, y se formaban grupos de gente disfrutando. \rLa ubicaci\u00f3n es incre\u00edble!

Hay lavander\u00eda, se puede comprar el jab\u00f3n en recepci\u00f3n. \rLo mejor es que inclu\u00eda tambi\u00e9n el desayuno: caf\u00e9, leche, cereales, pan, manteca, peanut butter, mermelada, pancakes, bananas. Hab\u00eda tostadora en la cocina. \rLas \u00e1reas comunes son muy lindas!

Ein Safeway Supermarkt ist ziemlich direkt nebenan und die Busanbindung ist ebenfalls gut. Die K\u00fcche war absolut genial, es hat an nichts gemangelt. Zahlreiche Herdplatten, Industriegrill, neue Pfannen, Geschirr, Besteck, Utensilien, Gew\u00fcrze ... Zudem gab es, auch wenn das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck weiterhin ausgesetzt war, morgens Kaffee. Preise zum Waschen sehr fair (1$ Waschen, 1$ Trocknen, 0,75$ Waschmittel). Alles war sehr sauber. Schlie\u00dff\u00e4cher unter dem Bett riesig, es passt ein gro\u00dfer Koffer rein und es ist trotzdem noch Platz vorhanden.",

Als ich morgens verschlafen auf dem Weg ins Bad war, meinte einer der Mitarbeiter ganz freundlich \u201cGuten Morgen!\u201d zu mir. Das hat mir direkt den Tag vers\u00fc\u00dft. Ich habe mich dort sehr wohl und sicher gef\u00fchlt. Beim n\u00e4chsten Mal bleibe ich auf jeden Fall wieder dort! Klimaanlage gibt es in diesem historischen Geb\u00e4ude \u00fcbrigens nicht. Da es aber ohnehin ziemlich frisch und windig in San Francisco ist, reicht das Bel\u00fcftungsger\u00e4t in jedem Zimmer und vorm Schlafen das Fenster ein Mal ordentlich \u00f6ffnen vollkommen aus.

Der Aufenthaltsraum ist sehr gro\u00df. Er wird genutzt um mobile Devise mit Akku zu versorgen. Hier stehen auch Kabel zur Verf\u00fcgung.",

It's right on Columbus and Lombard (the famous crooked street in SF), so it's easy to get to ALL the tourist areas . \rThe people were pretty nice, always smiling.\rTe room has a flatscreen, a fridge, a microwave oven and a sink. \rIt's right next to/in Little Italy, so lots of great neighborhood restaurants.",

The windows dont really close, so if you happen to be there over the weekend, there's a comedy club and the line to get in is right under your window.\rIt's good to book if you only need a place to sleep for a few hours and explore the city the rest of the time."

Even when full it has huge lockers that can have your backpacks inside and you can keep your trolley bag besides your bed.\n=> There are too many stairs.\nThe quiet dorm is on the third floor (second floor for me as I am used to having the ground floor as floor zero back home) which wasn't too many stairs at all. There are also chairs placed on every floor in case you need a breather before heading up.\n=> Being an introvert will I be able to talk to people and spend good time in the city since I know no one there.\nA great aspect of this hostel is that most of the staff are volunteers and they are world travelers themselves. Which brings about a totally different perspective and it makes it so easier to have conversations with them.\n=> What do I do in the city\nThe hostel folks have so many interesting activities planned for each day of the week, that you'll definitely find something to do. They have an answer to almost all your touristy queries.\n=> I'm traveling in Thanksgiving week and I don't have friends here. What would I do?\nThe hostel manager (who's a gem of a person himself) and the staff arranged an amazing Thanksgiving dinner for us all. Made me feel like I was sitting among friends that I've known for so long and made my stay memorable.\nIf people at the hostel are reading this, thank you so much for all that you do!\nHoping to run into you amazing folks someday somewhere soon!",

You do find places with 4 dorm beds pretty much for the same size cheaper in SF. Everyones stuff was laying around in the room so it was hard to even walk so you would not step on someones laptop etc. Although there seems to be lockers under the bed it was impossible to get hold of those because of the sheer amount of stuff scattered everywhere. I know this is not hostel's fault when people are messy but maybe letting guests know about the lockers and encouraging them to use those might be a good idea. I don't know how the rooms can ever be cleaned because of this but the place didn't seem dirty just a little run down. I didn't get much of a tour of the place so I had to figure out where the towels and even the toilets/shower where. The communal space gets cramped as well but hey at least it is way to meet people when you do have to share the table with others."
